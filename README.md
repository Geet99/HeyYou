# HeyYou

Problem Statement: 
Due to various factors prevalent in society, people are going in a state of depression and anxiety and sometimes they find themselves in a situation where nobody is there to hold their hands. So we are designing an app which can help in bringing these people to a stable state. 

Motivation behind choosing this project:
India’s rank has dropped to 140 out of 156 countries surveyed as per the World Happiness Report 2019. Keeping this in mind, we want to provide a platform to promote mental well-being and healthy habits through a self-care app transformed into a force of good that is less about likes and filters, and more about the user and user’s actual happiness. The purpose is to create a wellness application capable of tracking, recording, and displaying data relevant to a user’s mood habits. This application also enables individuals to become aware of deficiencies in their everyday habits and will hopefully encourage the user to self-regulate towards improvement. The overall goal is to show the user his or her daily habits and help them to make choices that will result in a healthier lifestyle, and therefore, happier, calmer and positive life.
We can cater to a variety of issues and ailments that help users to get over any trauma, and a mood tracker and daily motivational services. However, it won’t be a replacement for doctors, and not about health and fitness, but this mobile app is all about self-care or self-awareness, which is equal to self-love.

How will you solve the issue? (Functionalities)
Mood Tracking: Record the mood of the user by taking it as input periodically and then show how it fluctuates over time.
Mental Health Fitness Detection Test: We are making a proper questionnaire with multiple choice answers that confirms the user’s symptoms for different mental health issues. 
Daily Reminders(Notifications): Self-care tasks will be given to the user to improve their mood.
Diary Entry: Store diary entries and answers to questions asked.
Recreational channel: Drawing pad for art.  
Informative and Interactive section about Mental Wellness + Helplines: Reach out to helplines by calling directly through the app.
